The integration test repository is a small hg repository that's initially at the first commit when extracted. The
test runner will call "hg next" and pyre check; pyre incremental until it hits the tip.

You can use the following workflow to make changes:

$ tar xf fake_repository.tar; rm fake_repository.tar
* make changes to the commit you're interested in or amend, and
$ hg amend && hg restack or hg commit depending on the use case
$ tar cf fake_repository.tar *.py .watchmanconfig .hg .pyre_configuration
