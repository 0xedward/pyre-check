Python's type system was specified in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/). If you are new to Python's type system and want to learn the basics, we highly recommend you take a look at [mypy's cheatsheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html) as well as their [type system reference](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/builtin_types.html). The following discussion focuses on Pyre's approach to "gradual typing" and how you can get from an untyped codebase to a fully typed codebase.

## Gradual Typing
Most Python code does not (yet) start out as typed code. PEP 484 specifies a [gradual type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing) â€“ a type system that allows you to *gradually* add type annotations over time. It does so by

- only reporting errors on functions that have a return type annotation,
- by introducing an escape hatch: a special type `Any` that has all possible attributes and is both sub- and super-type of any other type,
- and assuming that all untyped fuctions implicitly return `Any`.

For example,
```python
from typing import List

def unannotated():        # implictly returns `Any`
    return b"" + ""       # function body is not checked

def annotated() -> List:  # Return annotation means we type-check `annotated`
    any = unannotated()
    any.attribute         # `Any` has all possible attributes
    return 1              # Error: returning `int` but expecting `List`
```

In combination these rules allow you to slowly annotate code without getting overwhelmed by type errors. You get more guarantees over time as you add more annotations. If you changed `unannotated` in the example above to return a `string` you would get a type error when accessing the attribute in `annotated`.

## Strict Mode
While the escape hatch `Any` is necessary for us to be able to annotate large codebases over time, it can hide legitimate type errors. We've introduced *strict mode* in Pyre to address this problem. Strict mode can be toggled at a module level by introducing a `# pyre-strict` comment to the file. In strict mode, Pyre will

- run on all functions, whether annotated or not,
- error on functions that are missing annotations,
- and error on annotations containing `Any` (with some exceptions to accomodate for common patterns).

In our previous example,
```python
# pyre-strict
from typing import List

def unannotated():        # Error: missing return annotation
    return b"" + ""       # Error: function body *is* checked

def annotated() -> List:  # Error: implicit `Any` for generic parameter to `List`
    any = unannotated()
    any.attribute         # Note: the type of `any` is still any.
    return 1              # Error: returning `int` but expecting `List`
```

As you can see in the example, `Any` can still sneak into modules that are strict but increasing strict coverage and fixing the surface errors will gradually eliminate them.

### Strict-By-Default
Strict mode can also be set as the default in a [project configuration](configuration.md). To opt individual files out of strict mode, use `# pyre-unsafe` in place of `# pyre-strict`.

## When Source Code is not Available
We do not always have access to all the source code with type annotations: e.g. `builtins` are compiled native code, or we might be using *cython*. Sometimes code is just too dynamic to be reasonably typed. Pyre will give precedence to type *stub files* with a `*.pyi` extension over source files when these are specified in the search path in the [project configuration](configuration.md) or if they are located next to the implementation file.
Stub files have the same structure as implementation files but only contain class- and function signatures:

```python
# my_dynamic_module.pyi
def dynamic_function() -> int: ...   # Function body is omitted
```

## Strategies for Increasing Coverage
Pyre comes with tooling to make it easy to increase type coverage in your project.

### Upgrade
When upgrading the type checker, new errors inevitably get surfaced. In order to keep a codebase clean but still be able to upgrade we've built `pyre-upgrade` which automatically suppresses newly surfaced type errors. It takes Pyre's output and will add supression comments to the code explaining what's wrong so that individual developers can easily address the issues.

You can run `pyre-upgrade` with
```bash
(venv) $ pyre --output=json | pyre-upgrade
```

### Automatic Type Inference
We have found tools that automatically add type annotations to code useful to get started with a project. There are two general approaches to automatic type inference: static inference and dynamic inference from runtime information. Both approaches come with their own trade-offs and we have found a combination of the two to be useful.

Pyre can do static type inference. You can run
```bash
(venv) $ pyre infer -i <directory or path>
```
to automatically apply annotations.

For dynamic inference we recommend you give [MonkeyType](https://github.com/Instagram/MonkeyType) a try.
